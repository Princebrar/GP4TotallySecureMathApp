##### Totally Secure Math App

##### GROUP - 4

##### BY: Princejot Singh, Preetinder Singh, Simardeep Kaur, Jaipal Singh Sidhu, And Divyanshu Kundra

This security assessment aims to identify and address vulnerabilities within the `Totally Secure Math App`. The key vulnerabilities identified are:

1. Insecure Data Storage -> Storing user credentials and notes in plain text within AsyncStorage.

2. Improper Authentication -> Utilizing hardcoded credentials for user authentication.

3. Code Injection -> Use of `eval` in the `Note` component to evaluate equations.

4. Insufficient Input Validation -> Lack of validation for user inputs, allowing invalid or malicious data to be processed.

5. Insecure Code Practices -> Hardcoded credentials, use of `eval`, and lack of encryption for sensitive data.

## Documentation of Vulnerabilities

1. Insecure Data Storage
   User credentials and notes are stored in plain text in AsyncStorage, making them susceptible to theft if the device is compromised.

Impact
Compromised data confidentiality and potential unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Risk: High

2. Improper Authentication
   Hardcoded credentials are used for user authentication.

Impact
Easily exploitable, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access.

Risk: High

3. Code Injection
   The use of `eval` in the `Note` component to evaluate equations can execute arbitrary code.

Impact
Potential for executing malicious code, leading to data breaches and other security issues.

Risk: High

4. Insufficient Input Validation
   Lack of input validation allows for the processing of invalid or malicious data.

Impact
Potential for injection attacks and application malfunctions.

Risk: Medium

5. Insecure Code Practices
   Hardcoded credentials, use of `eval`, and lack of encryption for sensitive data.

Impact
Increased risk of security breaches and data theft.  
Risk: High

## Security Measures Implemented

1. Secure Data Storage
   Utilized `react-native-keychain` to securely store user credentials, replacing the insecure AsyncStorage method.

```tsx
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain'; // Secure storage

const handleLogin = async (user: IUser) => {
    await Keychain.setGenericPassword(user.username, user.password);
    setSignedInAs(user);
};

Ensures sensitive data such as user credentials are stored securely, reducing the risk of data theft if the device is compromised.







2. Authentication Enhancement
Replaced hardcoded credentials with a secure authentication method using react-native-keychain.

tsx
Copy code
const login = async () => {
    // ... existing code ...
    if (foundUser) {
        await Keychain.setGenericPassword(username, password);
        props.onLogin(foundUser);
    } else {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Username or password is invalid.');
    }
};
Prevents unauthorized access by securely storing and retrieving user credentials.





3. Code Injection Prevention
Replaced eval with mathjs for evaluating mathematical expressions safely.

tsx
Copy code
import { evaluate } from 'mathjs'; // Secure replacement for eval

function evaluateEquation() {
    try {
        const result = evaluate(props.text);
        Alert.alert('Result', 'Result: ' + result);
    } catch (error) {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Invalid equation.');
    }
}
Prevents the execution of arbitrary code, mitigating the risk of code injection attacks.




4. Input Validation
Implemented input validation using the validator library to ensure that user inputs are valid and safe.

tsx
Copy code
import validator from 'validator'; // For input validation

if (validator.isEmpty(note.title) || validator.isEmpty(note.text)) {
    Alert.alert('Error', 'Title and equation cannot be empty.');
    return;
}
Ensures the integrity and safety of user inputs, reducing the risk of injection attacks and application malfunctions.




5. Secure Coding Practices
Adopted secure coding practices by removing hardcoded credentials, replacing eval, and using encryption for sensitive data.








Reflection:
During this process, I learned the critical importance of secure data storage, proper authentication practices, input validation, and avoiding insecure code practices. Implementing these security measures highlighted the need for a proactive approach to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Moving forward, I will ensure to:

Use Secure Storage:
Always use secure methods to store sensitive data, such as using keychain for credentials.

Implement Proper Authentication:
Avoid hardcoded credentials and use secure authentication mechanisms.

Prevent Code Injection:
Avoid using insecure methods like eval and adopt safer alternatives.

Validate Inputs:
Implement thorough input validation to ensure the safety and integrity of user data.

Follow Secure Coding Practices:
 Continuously follow and update secure coding practices to stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities.
