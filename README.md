# Security for Software Developers: Cross-Platform Security

## Introduction
In this lab, we identified and addressed vulnerabilities in a mobile app related to insecure data storage, improper authentication, code injection, insufficient input validation, and insecure code practices. We enhanced the appâ€™s security and applied best practices to mitigate potential risks.

## Identified Vulnerabilities
1. **Insecure Data Storage**:
   - Hardcoded credentials in `Login.tsx`.
   - Plaintext storage of notes in `Notes.tsx` with storage keys including plaintext credentials.

2. **Improper Authentication**:
   - No secure authentication practices (e.g., no hashed passwords).

3. **Insecure Code Practices**:
   - Use of plaintext credentials in storage keys in `Notes.tsx`.

## Implemented Security Measures
1. **In `Login.tsx`**:
   - **Password Hashing**: Utilized `crypto-js` for hashing passwords instead of storing them in plaintext.
   - **Secure Storage**: Replaced plaintext storage with `react-native-keychain` to securely store user session data.
   - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Added input validation and sanitization for username and password fields to ensure only valid inputs are accepted.

2. **In `Notes.tsx`**:
   - **Secure Storage**: Replaced plaintext storage with `react-native-keychain` to securely store notes.
   - **Refactoring**: Removed the use of plaintext credentials in storage keys.
   - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Added input validation and sanitization for note title and text fields to ensure only valid inputs are accepted.

## Reflection
During this process, we learned the importance of:
- **Secure Data Storage**: Ensuring sensitive data is encrypted and securely stored.
- **Proper Authentication**: Using hashed passwords and avoiding plaintext storage of credentials.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent code injection.
- **Insecure Code Practices**: Avoiding the use of plaintext credentials and implementing secure coding practices.

Moving forward, these best practices will be implemented to mitigate potential risks and enhance the security of software applications.
